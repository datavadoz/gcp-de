## Section 2: Data Engineering Concepts

### Data pipeline

There are 4 basic stages of data engineering pipeline:

![Data pipeline](images/section02/pipeline.png)

#### Ingest
Gather data from mutiple sources:
- From app: Event log, click stream data, e-commerce transaction,...
- Streaming ingest: PubSub.
- Batch ingest: Different transfer services, GCS - gutil,...

#### Store
Once the data is gathered, it's time to think about how to store that ingested data.
- Cost efficient & durable data storage.
- Different kinds of data need different kinds of storage.

#### Process and analyze
Once data is stored in an appropriate storage, it's time to process and analyze raw data into something meaningful via:
- BigQuery.
- ML: BigQuery ML, Spark ML with DataProc, Vertex AI.

#### Explore and visualize
Other than that, we can explore and visualize data via:
- Google Data Studio: Easy to use BI Engine (Dashboard & Visualization).
- DataLab: Interactive Jupyter Notebook that supports all data science libraries.
- ML Prebuilt API: Vision API, Speech API.

### Data type

There are 3 main kinds of data:

#### Structured data
- Tabular data.
- Represented by rows and columns.
- SQL can be used to interact with data.
- Fixed schema.
- Each row has the same number of columns.
- Relational databases are structured: MySQL, Oracle SQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL,...
- In GCP: Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner.

#### Semi-structured data
- Each record (row) has variable number of properties (column).
- No fixed schema.
- Flexible structure.
- NoSQL kind of data.
- JSON is the main main to represent semi-structured data.
- MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j.
- In GCP: BigTable, DataStore, MemoryStore.

#### Unstructured data
- No pre-define structure in data.
- Image, video,...
- In GCP: Google Cloud Storage.

### Batch Data vs Streaming Data

There are 2 main ways to process data:

#### Batching
- Data size is known.
- Processing data after certain periodic interval.
- Long time to process data.

#### Streaming
- Data size is unknown.
- Data is processed as it arrives.
- No much heavy processing - take millisecond or seccond to process data.

### Seciont 3: GCP Fundamentals

#### Regions & zones
GCP manages their services across multiple regions (Singapore, US West, ...). Inside individual region, there are multiple zones. Region is nothing but a geographical area and zone is a data center. The concept behind the region and zonze solves some of the problems:

- Low latency
- Follow government rules
- High availability
- Disaster recovery

![Region & Zone](images/section03/region_zone.png "Data types and their services")

The naming of region and zone follow pattern: `<region>-<zone>`
E.g: `northamerica-norteast1-a` means `northamerica-norteast1` region and zone `a`.
